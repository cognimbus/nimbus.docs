Installing the Agent
--------------------

The **Agent**, a pivotal component of Cogniteam's Cloud Platform,
empowers you to manage and interact with your robot from any location
globally. It facilitates the connection of robots to Cogniteam's
cloud services handle system software, dependencies installation, manages robot configurations, collects platform data,
monitors robot status, and enables remote control through the
Cogniteam Cloud Platform.

The Agent can be installed directly on our supported platforms
or inside a docker.

**Prerequisites**
Ensure that your robot operates on one of our supported platforms:

 - Ubuntu 16+ (x64, arm64)
 - Debian 7+ (x64, arm64)
 - Alpine Linux (x64, arm64)

**Dockerized Version**

Optionally, for a Dockerized version of the Agent, append "-docker" to the installation command. This version includes all necessary dependencies within a Docker image. Utilize the following terminal commands:

 - To start the agent use - “start_nimbus_docker”
 - To stop the agent use - “stop_nimnus_docker”
 - To update the agent use - “update_nimbus_docker”

**Note:** Updates for the Dockerized Agent can only be performed
through the provided terminal commands; Cloud Platform updates are
not currently supported.

**Installation on Windows 11 (using WSL2):**

Another option is to install the Agent on a Windows11 system by using
`Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about>`_, 
which is a feature of Windows that allows you to run a Linux environment on your Windows machine, without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual booting.

1. Use the admin powershell to install wsl2 by typing “wsl -install”
2. Configure DNS for WSL with the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:
   
   echo -e "[network]\ngenerateResolvConf = false" | sudo tee -a /etc/wsl.conf
   # add google DNS or replace 8.8.8.8 with a DNS provider of your choice
   sudo sed -i 's/nameserver [0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+/nameserver 8.8.8.8/' /etc/resolv.conf

3. Install a Docker client within WSL2 to ensure compatibility: run “docker”
4. Finally, execute the Agent installation command with "-docker" to complete the installation within the Windows 11 system

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the Cogniteam Agent,
providing seamless connectivity and control over your robot through
the Cogniteam Cloud Platform.
